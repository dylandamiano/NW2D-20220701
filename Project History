2/??/2022 - Work began on projectiles

2/16/2022 - Discovered that I am an idiot and cannot use a global variable in a
function without declaring 'Global' within the local scope first! :(

2/17/2022 - Tracking issue on why clouds wont delete: "List Index out of Range" -- ignored since January (6:14 PM EST)
			Fixed @ 7:29 PM EST

			- Continued work on projectiles

2/20/2022 - Started work on Island 3, but began with the wrong point slope values. Corrected later on.
			Just learn how to read :') @ Boundary 10 (Human computational error)

2/22/2022 - So here's the deal. When I originally made the function in 'gameCalculations.py', that was mainly
			intended to reflect the python coordinate system into one compatible for the pygame framework. In order to
			revert that back to pygame, it took me four hours to discover that I had to recovert it back to one compatible
			for pygame again. Why? Because when I was using pygame's coordinate system, that was practically reading it
			relative to one similar to desmos meaning that we have to do the inverse operation once more by doing 900-y.

			Remember how you cannot divide by zero in math class?
			Yes, well that happened to me too...  Smh.

			Determination has been made that the projectile casting system for the player will be broken up into 4 quadrants. In addition to this, each quadrant will have
			two sub-quadrants totallying the sub-quadrant count to 8. While such need currently does not exist, the capability for this will exist for if such determination is made in
			the future.

			Starting to actually get the system to display the projectiles in place. Will be done 2/23/2022
