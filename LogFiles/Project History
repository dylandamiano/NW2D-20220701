12/2/2021 - Project conceived, name for project not determined

2/??/2022 - Work began on projectiles

1/07/22 - Project uploaded to Github for 'safe-keeping'

2/16/2022 - Discovered that cannot use a global variable in a
			function without declaring 'Global' within the local scope first! 
			
			How did this slide past me the whole time? I don't know, don't ask me.
			All I do know is that stackoverflow is a wonderful resource!

2/17/2022 - Tracking issue on why clouds wont delete: "List Index out of Range" -- ignored since January (6:14 PM EST)
			Fixed @ 7:29 PM EST

			- Continued work on projectiles

2/20/2022 - Started work on Island 3, but began with the wrong point slope values. Corrected later on.
			Just learn how to read @ Boundary 10

2/22/2022 - So here's the deal. When I originally made the function in 'gameCalculations.py', that was mainly
			intended to reflect the python coordinate system into one compatible for the pygame framework. In order to
			revert that back to pygame, it took me four hours to discover that I had to recovert it back to one compatible
			for pygame again. Why? Because when I was using pygame's coordinate system, that was practically reading it
			relative to one similar to desmos meaning that we have to do the inverse operation once more by doing 900-y.

			Remember how you cannot divide by zero in math class?
			Yes, well that happened to me too...  Smh.

			Determination has been made that the projectile casting system for the player will be broken up into 4 quadrants. In addition to this, each quadrant will have
			two sub-quadrants totallying the sub-quadrant count to 8. While such need currently does not exist, the capability for this will exist for if such determination is made in
			the future.

			Starting to actually get the system to display the projectiles in place. Will be done 2/23/2022

2/26/2022 - Was working with the log history system for the game and ran into an issue when it came to getting the text to separate at an y-interval of 18 pixels.
			It was an error on my part because I was running the calculations before actually changing the values which kept giving me a value of 18.

			Example:

				log_iteration = 0
			
				y_start = 60.7
				y_add = 18 * iteration

				FOR LOOP:
					y_final = y_start + y_add :::: RETURNS --> 60.7 RATHER THAN EXPECTED RESULT

			Also in the process of making it to where the display log only shows 44 elements rather than every element at a time to conserve memory usage.
				As far as updating the display log list went, it was also an error on my part as I had to update the display log history while the game was running
				otherwise, some of the log entries would be missing since it would only update if you opened the menu.

2/27/22 - Added capability to show what you are going to playing as before the game actually starts.
		  Still has to be worked on somewhat that way you can actually play as the right entity. Will be done tomorrow.

2/28/22 - Performance has been noticed to been heavily impacted when utilizing the Fighter. The size of the fighter has to be scaled down to its desirable size
			that is fit for ingame use; otherwise, if the game scales it down, it sucks up processing power slowing down performance. I have tried to use multi-threading
			at first but that has proven to be a fruitless attempt in which I just completely tossed it to the curb and just stomped on it.

3/3/22 - Dumb-AI development started.
			Just a bunch of conditional statements as expected,
			nothing special to it. Really.
			
			Issue in hit boundaries at Island 2. Has to do something with Sub-Region 7 and or Box 3
			
3/4/22 - Boundary issue was actually at Sub-Region 3. It was just a mistake in regards to inequality comparison operators.

3/7/22 - Began work for AI to bounce-back from walls when too close.
		
			Also added "Splash" screen

			Adding 'player cooldown' for firing sequences
				- Originally did not work because of order of operations when comparing operators
				- Mistyped variable as well and that had something to do with it not working
