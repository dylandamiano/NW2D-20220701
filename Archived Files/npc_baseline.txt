The AI for the gameplay will be based upon a dumb-AI system...

An DUMB AI is an AI that has pre-determined output based on what it is given.
It will be utilizing a bunch of IF statements to help determine which path it will go on towards the player.

So far, I have thought of the following...
The movement for the AI will be based upon chance. HOWEVER,
the AI will determine a differnet spot to move to when the following happens:
- There are weapons being fired at any position on the map
- It is being fired at directly

The weapons system for the AI will be as follows:
- Fires at player when it is being fired at back
- Will consist of pre-programmed discrepencies, that way the player does not get annihilated at the start of the game.
	It also helps to ensure that the shots can actually hit rather than just firing at the players originating position

The player will determine how many AIs there are at the start of the game?
While this is a tentative idea, there will be a maximum of 4-6 AIs in the game at a given time considering that I
have the time to actually let the player choose how many they want.

If time is running short, then the AI system will be strictly based upon target-practice until
the AI combat system itself can actually be implemented.
